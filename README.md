# CTSE-DinoAR

# Introduction 
DinoAR is an augmented reality (AR) application that brings dinosaurs to life in your surroundings. Using ARKit, RealityKit, and SwiftUI, DinoAR detects specific image markers and overlays 3D dinosaur models onto them, creating an immersive and interactive experience for users.
Demonstration of the Working Product:

To see DinoAR in action, simply point your device's camera at one of the supported image markers, and watch as the dinosaurs come to life in your environment. The app recognizes the markers and places realistic 3D models of dinosaurs on top of them, allowing you to explore and interact with them as if they were really there.
Overview of Features and Functionality:

•	AR Dinosaur Experience: DinoAR provides an engaging AR experience where users can interact with various dinosaur models.
•	Image Marker Detection: The app detects specific image markers, triggering the appearance of dinosaurs in the AR scene.
•	Multiple Dinosaurs: DinoAR offers a variety of dinosaur models, each with its own animations and behaviors, providing users with a diverse and entertaining experience.
•	Other 3D Models: Elements of jungles are added to make it real life like. 









Description of the Markers Used: 
DinoAR utilizes ARReferenceImages for marker detection. These images act as triggers for placing the dinosaurs in the AR scene. Each image marker corresponds to a specific dinosaur model, and when detected, the associated dinosaur is overlaid onto the marker.
